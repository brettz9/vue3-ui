# vue3-ui

Very clean Vue3 components styled with love and care.

When adding dynamic variables for classes, do not forget to add them to `helper/data.ts`. Add them to `textual` if values are strings, or to `truthy` if values are boolean.

When adding transition, add its name to the `transitions` inside `helper/data.ts`.
